                    While growing up, I always believed the world to be a 'wish-granting factory'. 
                    But eventually as time flew by, I realised we are a part of a world with never-ending problems. 
                    However, technology is one such thing that has given me hope throughout my life. I believe that technology can make this world a better place to live in.

                    As a computer science engineer, Iâ€™ve got a vast exposure to latest technologies and tools that have shaped the world with hands-on experience in labs. 
                    Developing machine learning models for predictions, data analysis and visualisation have been some areas of my interest ever since I began my undergraduate journey.  
                    I am passionate about technology and I aspire to become a part of the burgeoning community and contribute my very bit to the society.
